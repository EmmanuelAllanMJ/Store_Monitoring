Here are the detailed todos for developing the backend APIs using FastAPI for the given task:

1. **Data Ingestion and Storage**
   - Download the three CSV files provided in the data sources section.
   - Create a database schema to store the data. You can use any database of your choice (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).
   - Write a script to read the CSV files and store the data in the database. You can use a database ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) to interact with the database.

2. **API Endpoints**
   - Create a FastAPI application with two endpoints: `/trigger_report` and `/get_report`.
   - Implement the `/trigger_report` endpoint:
     - This endpoint should trigger the generation of the report from the stored data.
     - Generate a random report ID and store it in the database along with the status of the report (e.g., "Running").
     - Start a background task to generate the report asynchronously.
     - Return the generated report ID as the response.
   - Implement the `/get_report` endpoint:
     - This endpoint should return the status of the report or the CSV file if the report generation is complete.
     - Retrieve the report ID from the request parameters.
     - Query the database to get the status of the report.
     - If the status is "Running", return "Running" as the response.
     - If the status is "Complete", generate the CSV file with the required schema and return it as the response.

3. **Report Generation**
   - Implement the logic to generate the report based on the stored data.
   - Retrieve the necessary data from the database (e.g., store status, business hours, timezone).
   - Calculate the uptime and downtime for each store based on the business hours and store status data.
   - Extrapolate the uptime and downtime based on the periodic polls to the entire time interval.
   - Format the report data according to the required schema.
   - Update the status of the report in the database to "Complete" once the report generation is finished.

4. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Write unit tests to ensure the correctness of the implemented functionality.
   - Document the API endpoints, request/response schemas, and any additional details in the code comments or a separate documentation file.
   - Provide clear instructions on how to run the application and any necessary setup steps.
